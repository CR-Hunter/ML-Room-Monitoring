PROJECT TITLE: Homework 2AUTHOR: Cecilia HunterDATE: 2/5/2026DESCRIPTION: The Jupyter notebook 'Kappa_Phase3.ipynb' reads data about home sensors from CASAS in hh126.csv and hh126annotated.csv, and imports data from the Single Elder Home Monitoring Gas and Position data in the UCI Repository.  It includes programming for to preprocess all three datasets, and perform initial data explorations, including descriptions, explorations of variables over time, correlations between sensor data, and initial supervised classification exploration. FILES INCLUDED:- Kappa_Phase3.ipynb: the main Jupyter notebook that performs data loading, processing, and plotting.- hh126.csv- hh126annotated.csvSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:- Python 3.x- pip (Python package installer)HOW TO SETUP AND RUN:1. Ensure Python 3.x (version 3.10 or higher) is installed on your system.2. Install required Python libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: 	pip install -r requirements.txt   This will install all necessary packages listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.3. Ensure files 'hh126.csv' and 'hh126annotated.csv' are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook4. Running the Notebook: In an IDE, run the notebook in a Jupyter kernel. You should be able to run all cells upon opening.EXPECTED OUTPUT:In addition to loading the data, there is an initial exploration of both the Single Elder Home Monitoring Gas and Position dataset including a graph of carbon monoxide over time, a heatmap of the correlation between sensor variables, and the frequency distribution of temperature in the home. In the annotated CASAS dataset, there is a brief description of features, a graph of room distribution by hour, and one of activity by room. In the CASAS data without annotations, in addition to the feature description, we have explored the distribution of room by hour. There is also included an initial supervised classification exploration of the annotated CASAS set. TROUBLESHOOTING:- If the script fails to execute, check that all required packages are installed correctly and Python is updated to the latest version.- Verify the path to 'hh126.csv' and 'hh126annotated.csv' is correct if the script cannot find the file.- Ensure that your data is formatted correctly as expected by the script. The unannotated CASAS data consists of one column, without a header. The annotated CASAS data consists of four columns without a header: date, time, room, and sensor status.  CITATIONS:Cook, D.
